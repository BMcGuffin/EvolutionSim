# EvolutionSim
My repository for an evolution simulator I'm designing.
It's an object-oriented program that utilizes an evolutionary algorithm to pit multiple groups of creatures against each other and allow the most "fit" ones to survive and pass on their traits. I originally developed it in Python, but I'm currently in the process of transcribing it to Java so that I can continue the project in a better constructed manner.
